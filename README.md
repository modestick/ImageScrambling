# Image Scrambling

This Python project lets you scramble and unscramble images using the logistic map algorithm.

## Features
- **Image Scrambling**: Transforms images into a scrambled state using the logistic map algorithm.
- **Image Unscrambling**: Restores scrambled images to their original form.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical computations.
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: For image processing capabilities.
- **Random**: For generating random values in the scrambling process.
- **argparse**: For parsing command-line arguments to control the script‚Äôs behavior.
- **os**: For handling files, directories, and paths.
- **datetime**: For datetime
- **zipfile**: For zipping files

## Installation and Usage on Windows üñ•Ô∏è

1. **Download the Project**
   - Download ZIP
   - Extract it

2. **Open Command Prompt in the Project Folder**
   Navigate to the project directory:
   - Hold `Shift`, right-click an empty space in the folder, and select **Open PowerShell window here** or **Open Command Prompt here**. A terminal window will open, ready for commands.
   **Note**: If **Open Command Prompt here** is unavailable, PowerShell is a suitable alternative.

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
   Create an isolated environment for the project‚Äôs dependencies:
   - In the Command Prompt or PowerShell, enter:
     ```bash
     python -m venv lms_env
     ```
     This creates a folder named `lms_env` for the project‚Äôs dependencies.
   - Activate the environment:
     ```bash
     lms_env\Scripts\activate
     ```
     The prompt will display `(lms_env)`, indicating the environment is active.
   - For PowerShell, use:
     ```bash
     .\lms_env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```

   **Purpose**: A virtual environment isolates project dependencies, preventing conflicts with other Python projects.
   **Note**: Omitting the virtual environment installs libraries globally, which is acceptable unless you manage multiple Python projects.

4. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the required libraries:
   - In the Command Prompt (with `(lms_env)` displayed), run:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
     This installs NumPy, OpenCV, and other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. The process may take a moment.

5. **Run the Script**

   Run the `lms.py` with either 'scram' or 'unscram YOUR_KEY' and the image filename or directory as arguments. EXAMPLES BELOW.
   ```bash
   python lms.py scram picture.png
   ```
   ```bash
   python lms.py scram randomimages/
   ```   
   ```bash
   python lms.py unscram lms_images/scrambled/scrambled.png lms_images/keys/key.npy
   ```
   `--zip_keys` an optional argument. Saves all keys into a single zipped .zip file.
   `--zip_images` an optional argument. Saves all scramble images into a single zipped .zip file.

   

6. **View Results**
   - The results will be saved as `lms_images/scrambled/scrambled.png`, `lms_images/unscrambled/unscrambled.png` and `lms_images/keys/key.npy`.

## Installation and Usage on Linux/Mac üêß

To set up and run the project on Linux or Mac:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open a terminal and navigate to your preferred directory (e.g., `cd ~/Desktop`).
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/modestick/ImageScrambling
     cd ImageScrambling
     ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   - Run this command in the project directory:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv lms_env
     source lms_env/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - Execute:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Run the Script**

   Run the `lms.py` with either 'scram' or 'unscram' and the image filename or directory as arguments (+ key for unscrambled) EXAMPLES BELOW.
   ```bash
   python3 lms.py scram picture.png
   ```
   ```bash
   python3 lms.py scram randomimages/
   ```   
   ```bash
   python3 lms.py unscram lms_images/scrambled/scrambled.png lms_images/keys/key.npy
   ```
   `--zip_keys` an optional argument. Saves all keys into a single zipped .zip file.
   `--zip_images` an optional argument. Saves all scramble images into a single zipped .zip file.




5. **View Results**
   - The results will be saved as `lms_images/scrambled/scrambled.png`, `lms_images/unscrambled/unscrambled.png` and `lms_images/keys/key.npy`.
